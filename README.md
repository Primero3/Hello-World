# Hello-World
# I am here to learn about Github pull request workflow
# I like flowers and have a chance to play with them at my work/studio and create beautiful floral arrangements for clients. 
# Colors, shapes and texture make my world happy and full.
# I love to cook and make my family bellies full. Food is our medicine.
# I love to read and to be lost in the worlds of books. Books are my friends. 
# I love animals; they are beautiful creatures. 
# My Shiba Inu Amber is awesome smart 3years old pup! She loves to bounce on our trampoline and play soccer balls with Aleksander, my son. 
# I love Ocean, mountains and woods. My backyard garden is my home heaven. 
# Traveling is my destination. People is my culture. Art is me.
